Start by inserting the wallet addresses into a file named wallets.txt, where each line contains a single wallet address.

Next, visit the following URL: https://dune.com/queries/2681615. Download the CSV file associated with this Dune query and store it in the same directory as your lz.py script. Once done, rename the CSV file to lz.csv.

If you want to alter the number of similarities a wallet must have to be included in the second sheet, you can do so by modifying line 98 in the lz.py script.
